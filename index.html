        <p>
          As a Ruby on Rails software developer with 5 years of experience at YoungCapital, I have honed my skills as a full-stack developer and become comfortable working with both front-end and back-end technologies. My expertise extends to JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, and jQuery. Additionally, I have gained valuable experience in Python and Java.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          In my work with Ruby on Rails, I have used RSpec to write tests and worked with JSONAPI. These experiences have allowed me to develop a deep understanding of best practices for developing robust and scalable software applications.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          I am a highly motivated and detail-oriented individual who is passionate about developing software that is both user-friendly and efficient. I am always eager to take on new challenges and to continue growing my skills as a software developer.
